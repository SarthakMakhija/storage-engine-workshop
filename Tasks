NA


1) People who are interested in building a storage engine
2) People who are into scaling the databases

Day1 - 3 hours
    What is storage engine?
    Forms of IO
        - standard IO
        - concept of page
        - memory mapping
    Read and write patterns
        - Sequential
        - Random
    Data structures for storage engine
        - B+Tree
        - LSM Tree
    RUM conjecture
    Let's build LSM Tree
        - WAL log (code)
        - Adding segments (code)
    Introducing Skip-list

Day2 - 3 hours
    Revision
    Introducing Memtable
    Building Memtable (code)
        - put
        - get
        - multiGet
    Introducing SSTable
    Converting Memtable to SSTable (code)
    Introducing Bloom filter
        - Writing a bloom filter (code)
        - Attaching bloom filter to an SSTable (code)

Day3 - 4 hours
    Revision
    Searching in SSTable (code)
        - Bloom filter revision
        - Adding an index block to SSTable
    Implementing Concurrency (code)
        - Understanding single writer and multiple reader pattern
        - Singular update queue pattern
    Adding a Db abstraction to connect all the pieces (code)
        - WAL
        - Memtable
        - Bloom filter
        - SSTable
    Implementing transactions (code) / (theory depending on the time left)
    How to measure performance (code)
        - Benchmark
        - google performance profiler
        - perf (Linux)
    Conclusion??
